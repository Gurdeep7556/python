# Write a Python program that creates an empty dictionary and then enters a loop where it repeatedly asks the user to choose one of the following options:
# 1.    Enter a new key-value pair into the dictionary
# 2.    Search for a value by key in the dictionary
# 3.    Quit the program

# If the user chooses option 1, the program should ask the user to enter a key and a value, and then add this key-value pair to the dictionary. 
# If the user chooses option 2, the program should ask the user to enter a key, and then print the value associated with that key in the dictionary (or a message indicating that the key is not in the dictionary). 
# If the user chooses option 3, the program should exit the loop and terminate.
